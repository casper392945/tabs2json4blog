    "og:description": "Our previous post on this topic explored two common paths that emerge in APIs — customization and configuration — each with its own pros and cons. Customization provides freedom and speed, while configuration offers cohesion and maintainability through the use of abstraction. The more abstractions we create in our APIs, the more we can control with ease — with less input from the user. The tradeoff is that the API becomes more opaque, and as a result, engineers may feel they have to wrestle with the API … or give up entirely in favor of local components.Since that first post, the Encore team has gotten to know our design system customers (fellow Spotifiers) even better",
